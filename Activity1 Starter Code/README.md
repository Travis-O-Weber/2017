Card Game Simulation

Overview

This repository contains a simple Java implementation of a Card class, representing a playing card, and a CardTester class, which is designed to test the functionality of the Card class.

Files

1. Card.java

The Card class represents an individual playing card with the following attributes:

Rank (e.g., "Ace", "King", "Queen", etc.)

Suit (e.g., "Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs", "Spades")

Point Value (an integer representing the card's value)

Key Methods:

public Card(String cardRank, String cardSuit, int cardPointValue): Constructor to initialize a card.

public String suit(): Returns the suit of the card.

public String rank(): Returns the rank of the card.

public int pointValue(): Returns the point value of the card.

public boolean matches(Card otherCard): Compares two cards for equality.

public String toString(): Returns a formatted string representation of the card.

2. CardTester.java

The CardTester class is a simple test suite designed to validate the functionality of Card.java.

The main method is currently empty and can be modified to test different aspects of the Card class.

How to Use

Compile the Java files:

javac Card.java CardTester.java

Run the CardTester class:

java CardTester

Modify CardTester.java to include test cases for creating and comparing Card objects.

Future Enhancements

Implement a deck of cards.

Add shuffling and dealing functionalities.

Develop a game simulation using the Card class.
