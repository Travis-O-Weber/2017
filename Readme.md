README for lab9.java

Description

This Java program calculates the average acceleration based on user-provided velocities and time.

How It Works

Prompts the user to enter the starting velocity, ending velocity, and time in seconds.

Calculates the average acceleration using the formula:

average_acceleration = (final_velocity - starting_velocity) / time

Displays the calculated average acceleration.

How to Run

Compile the program using:

javac lab9.java

Run the compiled program:

java lab9

Follow the prompts to enter the velocities and time.

Sample Output

Enter the velocity values to find acceleration
Enter starting velocity in m/s: 0
Enter ending velocity in m/s: 20
Enter time in seconds: 4
5.0

Notes

Make sure to have Java installed.

The Scanner is used for user input; close the scanner if extending the program.
