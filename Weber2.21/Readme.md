README for lab21.java

Description

This Java program calculates the total amount after applying simple interest.

How It Works

Prompts the user to enter the principal amount, interest rate, and time in years.

Calculates the interest using the formula:

interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100

Adds the interest to the principal to get the total amount.

Displays the total amount.

How to Run

Compile the program using:

javac lab21.java

Run the compiled program:

java lab21

Follow the prompts to enter the principal, rate, and time.

Sample Output

Enter principal amount: 1000
Enter rate: 5
Enter time (in years): 2
T:  1100.0

Notes

Make sure to have Java installed.

The Scanner is used for user input; close the scanner if extending the program.

The variable T represents the total amount (principal + interest).
