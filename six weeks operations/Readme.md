# Number Operations Calculator

A Java program that performs various mathematical operations and comparisons on three user-input numbers.

## Description

This program takes three numbers as input and performs multiple operations including:
- Calculating their product
- Performing a mixed operation (addition and multiplication)
- Finding the smallest number
- Finding the largest number
- Calculating the mean
- Finding the median

## Files
- `operations.java` - Source code file
- `operations.class` - Compiled bytecode file

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system
2. Compile the program:
javac operations.java
3. Run the program:
java operations

## Features

1. **Input Operations:**
- Takes three integer inputs from user

2. **Calculations:**
- Product of all three numbers
- Second number + (third number Ã— first number)
- Mean (average) of three numbers
- Median (middle value)

3. **Comparisons:**
- Identifies smallest number
- Identifies largest number
- Determines middle number (median)

## Usage Example
Please type the 3 numbers
5 10 15
The product of the three numbers is
750
The secound operation solution is
85
The first entered number is the smallest
The third entered number is the largest
The mean of the three numbers is
10
The median of the three numbers
The secound entered number is the middle number

## Technical Details
