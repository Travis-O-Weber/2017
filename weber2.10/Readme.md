Description

This Java program calculates the amount of energy needed to heat water based on temperature change and mass.

How It Works

Prompts the user to enter the starting temperature, ending temperature, and mass of water.

Calculates the energy using the formula:

energy = mass * (final_temperature - starting_temperature) * 4184

Displays the calculated energy.

How to Run

Compile the program using:

javac lab10.java

Run the compiled program:

java lab10

Follow the prompts to enter the temperatures and mass.

Sample Output

Enter the temperature and mass to find the amount of energy needed
Enter starting temperature in celsius: 20
Enter ending temperature in celsius: 100
Enter the amount of water in kilograms: 2
The amount of energy is = 670720.0
