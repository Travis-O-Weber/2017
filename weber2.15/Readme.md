README for lab15.java

Description

This Java program calculates the distance between two points given their coordinates.

How It Works

Prompts the user to enter the x and y coordinates for two points.

Calculates the distance using the formula:

distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)

Displays the calculated distance.

How to Run

Compile the program using:

javac lab15.java

Run the compiled program:

java lab15

Follow the prompts to enter the coordinates.

Sample Output

Enter the x coordinate for point 1: 1
Enter the y coordinate for point 1: 2
Enter the x coordinate for point 2: 4
Enter the y coordinate for point 2: 6
The distance between the two points is 5.0.

Notes

Make sure to have Java installed.

The Scanner is used for user input; close the scanner if extending the program.
