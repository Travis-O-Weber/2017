README for lab19.java

Description

This Java program calculates the area of a triangle based on three user-provided points.

How It Works

Prompts the user to enter the x and y coordinates for three points.

Calculates the area using the formula:

area = |(x1*y2 + x2*y3 + x3*y1 - x1*y3 - x2*y1 - x3*y2) / 2|

Displays the calculated area.

How to Run

Compile the program using:

javac lab19.java

Run the compiled program:

java lab19

Follow the prompts to enter the coordinates.

Sample Output

Enter the points x1: 1
Enter the points y1: 2
Enter the points x2: 4
Enter the points y2: 5
Enter the points x3: 6
Enter the points y3: 3
The area of the triangle is 5.5
