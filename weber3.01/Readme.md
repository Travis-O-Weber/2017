README for lab301.java

Description

This Java program calculates the discriminant and roots of a quadratic equation.

How It Works

Prompts the user to enter values for a, b, and c in the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0.

Calculates the discriminant using the formula:

discriminant = b² - 4ac

Based on the discriminant value:

If discriminant > 0, the equation has two real roots.

If discriminant == 0, the equation has one real root.

If discriminant < 0, the equation has no real roots.

Displays the results.

How to Run

Compile the program using:

javac lab301.java

Run the compiled program:

java lab301

Follow the prompts to enter the values for a, b, and c.

Sample Output

Enter the A value: 1
Enter the B value: -3
Enter the C value: 2
The discriminant is 1.0 The equation has two real roots The roots are 2.0 and 1.0

Notes

Make sure to have Java installed.

The Scanner is used for user input; close the scanner if extending the program.
